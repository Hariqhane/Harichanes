The method uses two-body equations of motion that are valid through (post)2-Newtonian order (order ((Gm/rc2)2)), but that also include test body effects in the Schwarzschild geometry exactly. The harmonic coordinate separation of the innermost stable orbit varies from the test body value of 5m to about 6m for equal masses, where m is the total mass. The orbital energy, angular momentum and frequency of the innermost stable orbit are also determined as a function of the ratio of the two masses. Implications of the results for detection of gravitational radiation by laser-interferometer gravitational observatories are discussed.}

	journal = {The Astrophysical Journal},
	abstract = {We present a weak-lensing analysis of 22 early-type (strong) lens galaxies, based on deep HST images obtained as part of the Sloan Lens ACS Survey. Using advanced techniques to control systematic uncertainties, we show that weak-lensing signal is detected out to ~300 h-1 kpc (at the mean lens redshift z = 0.2). We analyze blank control fields from COSMOS in the same manner, inferring that the residual systematic uncertainty in the tangential shear is less than 0.3%. A joint strong- and weak-lensing analysis shows that the average total mass density profile is consistent with isothermal (i.e., ρ ∝ r-2) over two decades in radius (3-300 h-1 kpc, approximately 1-100 effective radii). This finding extends by over an order of magnitude in radius previous results, based on strong lensing and/or stellar dynamics, that luminous and dark components ``conspire'' to form an isothermal mass distribution. In order to disentangle the contributions of luminous and dark matter, we fit a two-component mass model (de Vaucouleurs+NFW) to the weak- and strong-lensing constraints. It provides a good fit to the data with only two free parameters: (1) the average stellar mass-to-light ratio M*/LV = 4.48 ± 0.46 h M☉ L (at z = 0.2), in agreement with that expected for an old stellar population; (2) the average virial mass-to-light ratio Mvir/LV = 246 h M☉ L. Taking into account the scatter in the mass-luminosity relation, the latter result is in good agreement with semianalytical models of massive galaxy formation. The dark matter fraction inside the sphere of radius, the effective radius, is found to be 27% ± 4%. Our results are consistent with galaxy-galaxy lensing studies of early-type galaxies that are not strong lenses, in the 30-300 h-1 kpc radius range. Thus, within the uncertainties, our results are representative of early-type galaxies in general.}

	journal = {The Astrophysical Journal},
	abstract = {The cusp–core problem is one of the main challenges of the cold dark matter paradigm on small scales; the density of a dark matter halo is predicted to rise rapidly toward the center as ρ(r) ∝ r α with α between −1 and −1.5, while such a cuspy profile has not been clearly observed. We have carried out the spatially resolved mapping of gas dynamics toward a nearby ultradiffuse galaxy (UDG), AGC 242019. The derived rotation curve of dark matter is well fitted by the cuspy profile as described by the Navarro–Frenk–White model, while the cored profiles including both the pseudo-isothermal and Burkert models are excluded. The halo has α = −(0.90 ± 0.08) at the innermost radius of 0.67 kpc, M halo = (3.5 ± 1.2) × 1010 M ⊙, and a small concentration of 2.0 ± 0.36. The UDG AGC 242019 challenges alternatives of cold dark matter by constraining the particle mass of fuzzy dark matter to be <0.11 × 10−22 or >3.3 × 10−22 eV, the cross section of self-interacting dark matter to be <1.63 cm2 g−1, and the particle mass of warm dark matter to be >0.23 keV, all of which are in tension with other constraints. The modified Newtonian dynamics is also inconsistent with a shallow radial acceleration relationship of AGC 242019. For the feedback scenario that transforms a cusp to a core, AGC 242019 disagrees with the stellar-to-halo mass ratio dependent model but agrees with the star formation threshold dependent model. As a UDG, AGC 242019 is in a dwarf-sized halo with weak stellar feedback, late formation time, normal baryonic spin, and low star formation efficiency (SFR/gas).}

Cosmological simulations with nonbaryonic dark matter, however, predict self-similar halos with central density cusps. This contradiction has lead to the conclusion that dark matter must be baryonic. Here it is shown that the dark matter halos of dwarf spiral galaxies represent a one-parameter family with self-similar density profiles. The observed global halo parameters are coupled with each other through simple scaling relations which can be explained by the standard cold dark matter model if one assumes that all the halos formed from density fluctuations with the same primordial amplitude. We find that the finite central halo densities correlate with the other global parameters. This result rules out scenarios where the flat halo cores formed subsequently through violent dynamical processes in the baryonic component. These cores instead provide important information on the origin and nature of dark matter in dwarf galaxies.}

	abstract = {We investigate the finite source size effect in the context of the wave optics in gravitational lensing. The magnification of an extended source is presented in an analytic manner for the singular isothermal sphere lens model as well as the point mass lens model with the use of the thin lens approximation. The condition that the finite source size effect becomes substantial is demonstrated. As an application, we discuss the possible observational consequences of the finite source size effect on astrophysical systems.}

abstract = {The Stampede 1 supercomputer was a tremendous success as an XSEDE resource, providing more than eight million successful computational simulations and data analysis jobs to more than ten thousand users. In addition, Stampede 1 introduced new technology that began to move users towards many core processors. As Stampede 1 reaches the end of its production life, it is being replaced in phases by a new supercomputer, Stampede 2, that will not only take up much of the original system's workload, but continue the bridge to technologies on the path to exascale computing. This paper provides a brief summary of the experiences of Stampede 1, and details the design and architecture of Stampede 2. Early results are presented from a subset of Intel Knights Landing nodes that are bridging between the two systems.},
